      <center> <h2> <em> As We May Think </em></h2> </center>
      <p style="font-size: 15px"> The part of the reading I was intrigued by was the discussion on the human mind and how 
      <em>man</em> operates. Associative thinking is a human trait. The author states how a brain snaps from one item to the next that is suggested by a series of 
      associations arising from the trails carried by the brain's cells. Other characteristics of it include trails that are not often followed fading, 
      items that are not completely permanent, and temporarily stored memories. Nevertheless, the speed of action, the intricate trails, 
      and the nuances of mental images are the most striking features of nature. It is unlikely that man could fully duplicate this mental process artificially, 
      but he may be able to learn from it. But I often wonder why can't man figure out how to duplicate this process artifically with the use of technology? 
      Man can possibly improve marginally as the records are relatively permanent. From the analogy, it is clear that the first lesson to be drawn concerns selection. 
      It is possible to automate selection by association rather than indexing. In terms of speed or flexibility, the mind cannot compete, 
      but the permanent and clear nature of revived items should outdo the mind. Based on his discussion here, I can see more on how 
      science can be used to implement the methods by which the human race produces, stores, and consults its records, which the author 
      says later in the article. </p>

      <p style="font-size: 15px">The author implies a question of whether or not there could be a different way that information
    is transferred to the brain. When we create or absorb records, we use one sense at a time - the tactile when we touch keys, the oral when we speak, 
    and the visual when we read. The path might be established more directly one day, is it not possible? The eye sees by transmitting images via electrical vibrations along the optic nerve to the brain. 
    As in a television set, electrical vibrations are conveyed from the photocells that see the image to the radio transmitter that transmits it. All forms of intelligence, from sound to sight, have been reduced into variations in current 
    in an electrical circuit in order to facilitate their transmission. Humans are not immune to this process. How can we proceed from one electrical phenomenon to another without changing to mechanical movements? 
    "Mechanical movements" being the way are reactiveness and brain operates like an electric circuit. 
    I actually never thought of the way how humans use their 5 senses similar to an electric circuit.  </p>

    <p style="font-size: 15px"> The part that struck me the most about the reading is how social networking sites capture your data. 
        Most social networking sites provide value by capturing information you enter as you go: your birthday, your e-mail address, 
        your likes, and links showing who your friends are. Sites combine these pieces of data into great databases and use the 
        information to provide value-added services, but only within the sites. As soon as you enter your data into one of these 
        services, it cannot be used on another website. Each site is isolated from the others. You can see your site's pages on the Web,
         but not your data. If you have created a list of people in one site, you can view that list on the Web, but not send that list 
        to another site.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 15px">This reminds me of what I was analyzing in another course of mine, Privacy in Electronic Society. 
        Once you enter information online, you will never truly see how your data is being used. Its what some may call the "privacy paradox". 
        Similar to what the reading was saying about entering your information online and how it is essentially "kept", people may also 
        install things like ad blocking software, delete cookies, etc. But corporations actively resist these attempts by hiding cookies 
        in flash videos when users delete cookies. The author also says, "A related danger is that one social networking site-or one search
         engine-or one browser gets so big that it becomes a monopoly, which tends to limit innovation". Innovation within these sites is 
         also limited the more the community gets turned off by the way how sites may use their information without their knowledge or 
         permission.</p>
